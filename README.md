# Happy Frog - AI Support & SDR Agents

A simple marketing website for Happy Frog, a service that provides AI Support Agents and AI SDR Agents for businesses.

## Project Overview

This is a lightweight marketing website built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features:

- Responsive design with a green and white color scheme
- Information about AI Support and SDR Agent services
- Lead capture form for potential clients
- Smooth scrolling navigation
- Simple testimonial slider

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `styles.css` - CSS styling
- `script.js` - JavaScript for interactivity
- `images/` - Directory containing website images

## Getting Started

To view the website locally, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

```
open index.html
```

## Customization

- Colors can be modified in the `:root` section of the CSS file
- Content can be updated directly in the HTML file
- Images can be replaced in the `images` directory

## Form Handling

The contact form currently has client-side validation and shows an alert on submission. In a production environment, you would need to implement server-side form processing to capture and store lead information.
